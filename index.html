    <h4> Two dreams i would love to do </h4>
    <p> Put on an epic dance show with Jennifer Lopez!
      Shes my idol, i know she sings and acts but i love her dancing. She makes
      dancing in heels look so easy. Her dancing skills are amazing, i look up
      to her because dancing has always been my passion in life. I have a bad
      back, but i dont let that stop me from dancing. Woud be a dream come true.
    </p>
    <p> Complete a huge outdoor obstacle course!
      Like the shows "The Challenge" and "Wipeout", I want to see how strong my
      body and mind is. I love watching these shows not because of people wiping
      out, even tho its funny. But to see how good your teamwork is and
      communication. I want to learn more about myself. </p>

    <h6> Loves all things Supernatural </h6>
    <p> I love Halloween!
       I love my horror films especially the one's based on a true story. I
      like the adrenaline of being scared, don't know why; I just do. I believe
      there are entities and unexplainable things in this world. I also have my
      fears, I hate killer clowns, ventriloquist dolls, the ocean (scary
      stuff in there), spiders, falling, very very small spaces, and being in
      the pitch black darkness. I have a few horror movies i hate, the two
      common ones are "IT" and "Dead Silence". I you want to watch a horror film
      im the person to ask to watch it with.</p>

    <h7> My Furbabies </h7>
    <p> They are my world, the dog's name is Roxie and the cat's name is Luna.
      Roxie loves to swim; she knows how to dance, play fetch, jump over high
      objects and shake a paw.
      Luna is her own little character, she gets her sassy, fiesty attiude from
      me. She pefers to be alone but can become super cuddly when she wants to
      be. I call her my mini panther. </p>
